# data-binding-
this is my first hands on experimenting of data binding in android studio.
for projects with very big view hierarchy using views in kotlin class by the help of getViewById() makes the app slower because the program should traverse through a 
very big view hierarchy every time that function is getting invocked. 
so to make things simpler a data binding class is created with all the needed views being invoked already for us. 
using data binding feuture our app is made much faster.
